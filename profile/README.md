<h1 align="center"> <a href="https://code2kri8val.substack.com"> Code to Create Value </a> </h1>

Code to Create Value or CTCV is an idea, a philosophy, for everybody who knows how to code. No matter what language you speak, or what your background is, if you learn coding, you can use it for value creation. 
Doesn't matter if it's used by nobody, you are not a company selling its product, you are a person who wants to make projects to practice their skills or [for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/), with an aim to create something useful.

The main thing to focus on is the intention and not the outcome. Pure intentions are what most people lack, but you can be different. You should learn not only professional skills but life skills too, and CTCV is about this only.


You are successful, when you can smile at the fact that you have done something good for the world.
